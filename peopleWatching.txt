JustThis is so weird.

I hope this doesn't look sociopathic. I'm really just doing it for the creativity and to learn kraken.

I'm going to people watch and keep notes. Let's see how diverse this University REALLY is.

Girl sitting next to me has some cool tiffany blue headphones, but they might be off brand. Can't read it from here. Bleh.

Uggs. Really? I didn't know those were still a "thing".

Beards are making a big comeback though. I dig it. Dude matched his shoes with his leather jacket. Double Dig It.

The one look I'll never get behind is gym clothes/pajamas. You're leaving your house and you never know who'll you'll be making your 1st impression on. I know you probably don't care what people think, but I think you should care about the first impression you leave and gym clothes just doesn't do it for me. 

Just saw someone that reminded me of something I need to pick up at the grocery store, but I've forgotten what it is already... shit.

Not only am I way too distracted by this jam (Drowning World by Andrew Applepie) to people watch but... forgot what I was going to say... poop.

Just remembered spring training starts soon, which means baseball season starts soon too and now I want to go throw a ball with someone. 

But that brings me to another issue/non-issue... Will we ever get snow this year? "Greatest Snow on Earth" Amirite!?
